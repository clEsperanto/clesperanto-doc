Filters
-------

The tiers hold the different operations that are available in CLIc.
These operations are grouped by their complexity, following the rules that a function in tier N implement a function from tier N-1.
This organisation is only visible in ``CLIc`` and is not exposed to the user. It is mainly an internal organisation to facilitate the development and the maintenance of the library.
